# Walter-Conwell-Portfolio

This is my portfolio. I will be coming back to this repo over time to make changes.

Code Citation

I had some help from Dominique Meeks Gombe (my tutor) with using flexbox.
I used chat.gpt to confirm if certain lines of code were semantically correct. For example, changing div elements to aside, etc.
I also used w3schools to get some help regarding css styling (specifically, using ID's and classes to make it easier to target specific elements.)
